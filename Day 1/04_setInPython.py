# Set in python is used to store only unique values
s1 = {22,25,14,21,5}
print(s1)

#  Set don't allow the duplication and also its sequence is not predicted, it use hash set to fetch value faster
s2 = {20,21,23,27,21}
print(s2)

# As the values are put randomly so we can't use indexing in set
# print(s1[2])
